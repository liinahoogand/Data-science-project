## Motivation and goals
Our project centers around the Kaggle dataset "Predict students' dropout and academic success," featuring 35 columns and nearly 4,500 rows. 
We aim to uncover the key factors influencing students' dropout and graduation rates, collectively referred to as the "students target." 
Due to the fact that this dataset has so many columns and factors to work with, we have made static dashboard illustating basic facts about the dataset 
(peoples age, number of men and women, etc.) and basic correlations.

Our primary goal is to learn from fellow students and optimize our academic decisions. To achieve this, we'll:<br />
-Analyze the dataset's fundamentals.<br />
-Identify influential factors affecting dropout and graduation rates.<br />
Through these goals, we aim to extract meaningful insights and contribute to a collective understanding of academic success dynamics.

## Guide
In this repo we have a file named ....... and also the dataset. Download both of the files into your computer and you can open them in 
either Google Collab as we did or in a more mainstream Jupyter Notebook. <br />
In our file you will see that everything is catogrised: <br />
1. Introduction to the dataset - here we take a closer look into the dataset and define what the columns and their values mean.
2. Some basic data analysis - here we take a closer look into the dataset values and have graphs depicting the database and its basic correlations.
3. Static Dashboard - here we have made a static dashboard which has most of the graphs that we made previously.
4. Correlation analysis - here we are getting more in depth with the correlations, constructing heat maps and making a prediction model.
5. Hyphotesis - here we are stating a hypothesis and testing it.
